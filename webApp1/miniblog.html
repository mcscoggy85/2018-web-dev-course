        <h3>Python 2 - The end of the world as we know it.</h3>
        <p>
            It will happen. In the year 2020 an event will occur that will alter
            the course of information security forever. What is this apocalyptic
            event? The end of life for Python 2. Is it that big of a deal? Meh.
            I'm just being dramatic. As of 2020 they will stop releasing updates
            and patches to Python 2. But Python 2 isn't going anywhere.
            If history has taught us lessons about what happens to unsupported
            software then we will continue to see it running critical
            infrastructure and hospital equipment for many years to come.
            Those programs that run in Python 2 interpreters today will continue
            to run in Python 2 interpreters well after 2020. Sadly today some
            organizations are still running old Python 2.5 interpreters despite
            the fact that it is now 13 years old and has serious security issues.
            It's pretty safe to say that we will continue to see Python 2 for the
            foreseeable future.
